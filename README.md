# StudyShuffle
Introducing my latest creation, the StudyShuffle web app is a companion for efficient and engaging learning. With a unique Shuffle feature, StudyShuffle adds an element of surprise to your study sessions by randomizing flashcards, keeping your mind sharp and engaged. 
Take charge of your progress with customizable stacks, effortlessly moving conquered cards to a separate stack for focused revision. I used HTML/CSS for a seamless user interface. StudyShuffle isn't just a flashcard app; it's a personalized journey towards mastering your material with a touch of innovation.
